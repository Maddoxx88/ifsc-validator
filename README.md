## Introduction
[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com) ![Status](

There are many APIs out there and one of them which I found interesting is the Razorpay IFSC API made by their own dev team. They came across the issue of not having a centralized API for validating and querying IFSC codes they built one and it is super easy to use and it is OPEN SOURCE! So, I thought of making a simple app which everyone can use for validating any IFSC Code before making a transaction using Flutter.

**Available ONLY for Android.**

## Features

* A simple & clean UI
* Checks if IFSC Code Exists
* Display details regarding the IFSC Code

## Packages Used
